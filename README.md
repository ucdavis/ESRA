# UC Davis Employee Salary Review Application (ESRA).

Application for comparing employee salaries for the purposes of equity reviews at UC Davis.  Integrates tightly with the campus PPS system through our PPS Data Mart.

Note: In order to keep the data up to date, you need to run the scripts in the /ESRA.Db/Jobs/ folder on a regular basis (we run them nightly).

A CAES Dean's Office production.
